defmodule Hyperliquid.Api.Exchange.KeyUtils do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared utilities for resolving private keys and validating addresses in exchange modules.

  ## Private Key Resolution

  All exchange modules accept an optional `:private_key` in their opts keyword list.
  When not provided, the key is resolved from `Hyperliquid.Config.secret()`.
  If neither is available, a clear error is raised.

  ## Address Validation (Sensitive Actions)

  Transfer and withdrawal actions (UsdSend, Withdraw3, SpotSend, SendAsset,
  ApproveAgent, ApproveBuilderFee) accept an optional `:expected_address` in opts.
  When provided, `Signer.derive_address/1` is used to verify the private key
  matches the expected address, preventing accidental use of an agent sub-key
  for actions that require the real private key.

  ## Breaking Change (v0.2.0)

  `private_key` was previously the first positional argument in all exchange module
  functions. It is now an option in the opts keyword list (`:private_key`).
